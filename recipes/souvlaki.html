    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      In this pork souvlaki recipe, seasoned bits of pork are soaked in a
      bright, savory marinade for as long as you can stand it! Serve with rice
      and a cucumber-tomato salad.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>1 medium lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 pounds pork tenderloin, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes</li>
      <li>3 large bay leaves, broken into pieces, or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk oil, wine, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper together
        in a bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Add pork, coat with
        marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the
        refrigerator for at least 24 hours, or up to 5 days.
      </li>
      <li>
        When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly
        oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove pork from marinade and shake off excess. Thread pork onto metal
        skewers, placing broken bay leaves between some pieces. Reserve marinade
        for basting.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook skewers on the preheated grill for 10 minutes, turning and basting
        frequently. Discard marinade. Continue to cook until pork is cooked
        through and the juices run clear, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F
        (63 degrees C).
